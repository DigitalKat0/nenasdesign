                <p>The aim of this observational usability test was to understand how second grade Japanese students naturally interact with the English alphabet puzzle game. Specifically, the goals were to:</p>

                  <h1>Motivation</h1>
                <p>I want to provide children a fun and engaging way to learn the English alphabet other than just providing them worksheets to work on. </p>

                <h1>Task Description</h1>
                <p>We didn’t want to give the kids instructions at first. We just wanted them to play the game and simply see how they react. So there wasn’t an explanation about the timer, letters, or controls. This is what the prototype looked like: </p>

                <h1>Design Refinements<h1>
                    <p>Based on the results and feedback gathered from the usability test, I made several adjustments to the design. These iterations aimed to enhance usability and improve user experience by addressing specific pain points identified during testing. </p>
                    <img src="images/DesignRefinements.png" alt="Technical Components" class="centered-image">
                    <p>The current status of the game is more clear with its goal and instructions. Feels calm, simple, and focused. It’s more age appropriate and intuitive. </p>

            <h1>Takeaways</h1>
            <p>In the future, I would like to further test the current version of the game. I would add audio feedback and have the character be more involved in reactions, but these are minor improvements. Overall, the redesign demonstrates effective child-centered design principles simple instructions, positive tone, and clear interaction. Resulting in a smoother and more enjoyable learning experience.</p>
