            <h1>Takeaways</h1>
            <p>Through this project I learned a lot about the UX process. I really enjoyed researching and getting the chance to interview people and create an experience based on real user feedback. Along with learning more in depth about the UX process, I also gained new experience managing a team and coworking with programmers. Also, since we were a small team with a limited skill set I learned new skills as we needed. Such as 3D modeling, but our small skillset prevented us from creating more of a unique experience. I wish we could’ve made a better AR experience.</p>
