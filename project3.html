                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>To what extent can digitalizing the in person grocery shopping experience improve customer behavior and satisfaction? In this short project we used Aldi shoppers as the main target audience. for a starting bases, I asked customers shopping if they like shopping in person or digitally and why. </p>

                <p>Overall Aldi customer love and prefer shopping in person because: </p>

                <h1>Persona</h1>
                <p>For this project, we created a persona to better understand the potential impact of digitalizing the in-person grocery shopping experience on customer behavior and satisfaction.</p>
                <img src="images/Persona.png" alt="Before and After Design" class="centered-image">
                <p>Flora really likes local stores and wants to shop in person not with delivery services. She’s also not familiar with digital systems so she isn’t so open minded about online payment and sharing her card information. </p>
                <h1>Experience Mapping</h1>
                <p>We organized and created a user journey map based on the persona. This map details the user’s experience at each step. Through the user journey map, we can identify the user's pain points. </p>

                <h1>Turning User Pain Points into App Solutions</h1>
                <p>We used these user pain points  as our insights to develop the design goal  </p>
                <img src="images/UserPoints.png" alt="Before and After Design" class="centered-image">
                <h1>Design Goals</h1>
                <p>Ultimately, the solution should be a mixture of digitalisation and reality. </p>
                <img src="images/DesignGoals.png" alt="Before and After Design" class="centered-image">
                <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
                <p>To help vizualise the user’s journey further, we thought a storyboard would be useful to help keep us on track.  </p>
                <img src="images/Storyboard.png" alt="Before and After Design" class="centered-image">
                <h1>Paper Prototype</h1>
                <p>We created a paper prototype because it allowed for us to do quick iterations and early user testings.  </p>
                <div class="prototype-flex-container">

            <h1>Takeaways</h1>
            <p>Through this project I learned a lot about the UX process. I really enjoyed researching and getting the chance to interview people and create an experience based on real user feedback. Along with learning more in depth about the UX process, I also gained new experience managing a team and coworking with programmers. Also, since we were a small team with a limited skill set I learned new skills as we needed. Such as 3D modeling, but our small skillset prevented us from creating more of a unique experience. I wish we could’ve made a better AR experience.</p>
