        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          To what extent can digitalizing the in-person grocery shopping experience improve customer behavior and satisfaction?
          In this short project we used Aldi shoppers as the main target audience. As a starting basis, I asked customers
          shopping if they like shopping in person or digitally and why.
        </p>

        <p>Overall Aldi customers love and prefer shopping in person because:</p>

        <h1>Persona</h1>
        <p>
          For this project, we created a persona to better understand the potential impact of digitalizing the in-person grocery
          shopping experience on customer behavior and satisfaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Flora really likes local stores and wants to shop in person, not with delivery services. She’s also not familiar with
          digital systems, so she isn’t very open-minded about online payment and sharing her card information.
        </p>

        <h1>Experience Mapping</h1>
        <p>
          We organized and created a user journey map based on the persona. This map details the user’s experience at each step.
          Through the user journey map, we can identify the user's pain points.

        <h1>Turning User Pain Points into App Solutions</h1>
        <p>We used these user pain points as our insights to develop the design goal.</p>

        <h1>Design Goals</h1>
        <p>Ultimately, the solution should be a mixture of digitalisation and reality.</p>

        <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
        <p>
          To help visualize the user’s journey further, we thought a storyboard would be useful to help keep us on track.
        </p>

        <h1>Paper Prototype</h1>
        <p>
          We created a paper prototype because it allowed us to do quick iterations and early user testing.
        </p>

        <h1>Takeaways</h1>
        <p>
          Through this project I learned a lot about the UX process. I really enjoyed researching, interviewing people,
          and creating an experience based on real user feedback. Along with learning more in depth about the UX process,
          I also gained experience managing a team and collaborating with programmers. Since we were a small team with a
          limited skill set, I learned new skills as needed — such as 3D modeling. However, our limited skills prevented us
          from creating a more unique experience. I wish we could’ve made a better AR experience.
